        <p><strong>The novel about brain surgery</strong></p>
        <p><strong>that isn’t about brain surgery.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>His name is Paul.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>He writes.</strong></p>
        <p>Paul Flower is an author, advertising copywriter/creative director and a journalist.</p>
        <p>He has written and produced award-winning advertising for print, radio, television, outdoor, the Web––really, just about every medium––for business-to-consumer and business-to-business accounts.</p>
        <p>His news features have appeared in regional and national magazines. His first novel, “<%= link_to "The Redeeming Power of Brain Surgery", "http://scribe-publishing.com/the-redeeming-power-of-brain-surgery-by-paul-flower/" %>,” was published in June 2013 by Scribe Publishing.</p>

      <div id="Runner" class="hideable">
        <p><strong>The writer who runs. Slowly.</strong></p>
        <p>Paul Flower was a runner in high school, where he made up for being mediocre by also being somewhat of a goofball and pretty slow. At mid life, after discovering a writing career can lead to becoming a goofball who is soft and out of shape, he returned to running.</p>
        <p>His interest in the sport, in turn, led him into coaching his local middle school and high school teams. The runners on the teams were much faster than he ever was.</p>

        <p><strong>This is where Paul shares his thoughts.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>(Okay, just one of the places he shares his thoughts.)</strong></p>
        <p>Paul Flower has been writing professionally for more than 30 years and has been spewing his opinions to anyone who will listen (and many who won’t) for much longer than that. Consider yourself warned.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I could be a random thought or quote from Paul, right here.</p>
