To do:
*Tweaks:
**So, the “critics quotes” work, but I’m bothered by the layout somewhat––the subsequent headlines/photos have the headlines right over the photos and that works. The critic quotes, could they be centered against the green background? They seem out-of-kilter this way. Know what I’m saying?

**On the social media feed, what will appear there? Currently there are tweets from a couple of people I follow on Twitter, I think. Will it be my most current tweets? Or what? 

**The Facebook link is to my Facebook page. I think we should make it to the Paul Flower, Writer page instead. 

**One other nitpick: the headlines ("The novel about brain surgery…” etc.) on each page are double-spaced. Any way they can be single-spaced?
