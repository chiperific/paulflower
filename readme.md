* Consider http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-groups for mobile screen size.
** will need to edit coffeescript
** will need to DOM-chain through UL > LI to swap "tab" for "btn"
** See Justified Link Variations

* all hideable divs appear on page load - needs fix.
* Structure content sections for mobile
** Consider hide images (because of banner)
** Consider text before images
